#Inspect Container Processes

 - If you wanted to run any command to container or check status of the process, you will login into container check the proces

 - But using exec you can run the command with out logging into the container

   - docker exec <running_container_name> /bin/ps aux
   - docker exec <running_container_name> /bin/ps
   - docker exec <running_container_name> /bin/free -m

  : Note when you exec to run the command on the container, we need to use the full path of the command

 - If you login into the container, run a command the container will shutdown.If you want to login to the container, but do not want the container to be stopped after the exit, you need to the exec with interactive terminal

   - docker exec -i -t <running_container_name>  /bin/bash

 - If you want to get the stat of container process or activity doing on the container, you can use 

   - docker stats <running_container_name>. 

 - Using the stats the container keeps on refreshing the activity every second and stdout the logs

# Previous Container Management

 - To list all the images on the host
	- docker images
        - docker ps -a -q | wc -l # number of docker images started and stopped
        - docker stop <container_id> # stop a running container
        - docker rm <container_id> # remove stopped container
        - docker rm -f # Force stop and remove a container
        - sudo docker rm -f <container_id> # If you don't have the privilages

 - There is also anthoer way remove the container
 	- sudo systemctl stop docker 
        - remove the container directory from /var/lib/docker
        - start docker using sudo systemctl start docker

# Controlling Port Exposure on Containers

  # To export a port from container to localhost 
   - docker run -itd -p 80 nginx:latest /bin/bash

  # To expose port 80 and redirect port 8080 on the host to container
   - docker run -itd -p 8080:80 nginx:latest /bin/bash
 
  # To randomly pick any local port and redirect to container ports use -P

   - docker run -itd -P nginx:latest /bin/bash

  # To expose a port and limit only the local host and redirect local port 8081 to 80, use the IP address before port redirection
   - docker run -itd -p 127.0.0.1:8081:80 nginx:latest /bin/bash

 # To expose a port, limit to IP Address and redirect based on specific protocal tcp/udp
   - docker run -itd -p 127.0.0.1:8081:80/tcp nginx:latest /bin/bash
   - docker run -itd -p 127.0.0.1:8081:80/udp nginx:latest /bin/bash

# Naming Our Containers

 --> Giving a user defined name when initiating the container
  	- docker run -it --name "<user_defined_container_name>" <image_name:tags> /bin/bash 
 --> Rename the container after the container is initiated. Be it a running container or stopped one
	-  docker rename <old_container_name> <new_container_name>
 --> Rename the container name with container Id. This will not change the contianer ID, it changes only the name associated with the container ID. It is not possible to change the container ID once assigned by system
  	- docker rename <container_id> <new_container_name>

# Docker Events
 -- Docker events basically used on the docker host to monitor the events happening with containers started, attached, died, stopped.
 -- To monitor all the events happenning to the container on the host, you can use "docker event" command, which runs stop in foreground contineously and check for any new events
	- docker events
	- docker events --since '1h' # Check the events in the last 1h
 -- Lets say you ran command on container using exec with the same 
	- docker exec -t mynewidname /bin/bash
    Then when you have the "docker events" running, you can capture the below events
    2018-01-06T10:47:31.045106335-08:00 container exec_start: /bin/bash  4bf427b88008d67b5141b826453db07d8bc3287d90c24d028eb741b1818b628c (image=ubuntu:xenial, name=hopeful_poitras)
-- For action happened on the host with respect containers will be captured into docker events and can be used for monitoring and alerting purposes

-- docker events can also be used to filter specific events. For example the below filter will, only capture the events for the containers that are attached
   - docker events --filter event=attach

   Events_output looks as below
   2018-01-06T10:32:08.260834220-08:00 container attach <Full_container_ID> (image=<image_name:tag>, maintainer=<MAINTAINER> Docker Maintainers <maintainer email@email.com>, name=<container_name>)

  - docker events with multiple filters

docker events --filter event=attach --filter event=die --filter event=stop

# Managing and Removing Base Images

  - docker rmi <image_name:tags> # Remove a image
  - docker rm <container_id> or <container_name> # Remove a container before removing an image
  --If you have container start with base image and it is running or it is stopped and when you try to delete the base image, you may receive a conflict. 
  -- you leave runnning or container as is and delete the base using -f/--force switch along with docker rmi command 
	  - docker rmi -f <image_name:tag>
  -- There is also another scenarios you may need force is that if you have multiple images with image_id but different tags. Even in such scenario if you need to delete the image with image_id,  it conflict with other images with different tags.
