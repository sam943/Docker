NOTE: Although you should be able to run these commands on any Docker version on any Linux Distribution, for the purposes of these exercises, be sure you are running Docker v1.10+ as well as the latest CentOS or Ubuntu distribution. Be sure to have pulled the 'centos:6' and 'ubuntu:latest' images from the Docker Hub (docker pull) before starting this exercise.
1. Create a directory called 'custom' and change to it. In this directory, create an empty file called "Dockerfile". 
 
- mkdir custom ; touch Dockerfile

2. Edit the "Dockerfile" created in Step #1 above. This configuration file should be written to perform the following actions:

Use the base Centos 6 Latest version image from the public repository
 - FROM centos6:latest
Identify you and your email address as the author and maintainer of this image
 - MAINTAINER sam943@gmail.com
Update the base OS after initial import of the image
 - RUN yum update -y 
Install the Open-SSH Server
- RUN yum install -y openssh-server
Install Apache Web Server
- RUN yum install -y httpd
Expose ports 22 and 80 to support the services installed
- EXPOSE 22 80
