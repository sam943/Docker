NOTE: Although you should be able to run these commands on any Docker version on any Linux Distribution, for the purposes of these exercises, be sure you are running Docker v1.10+ as well as the latest CentOS or Ubuntu distribution. Be sure to have pulled the 'centos:6' and 'ubuntu:latest' images from the Docker Hub (docker pull) before starting this exercise.

1. Create a directory in your 'user' home directory called 'docker'. Within that directory, create another directory called 'mydata'. Within that directory, create a file called 'mydata.txt' containing any text message you want.

 - mkdir mydata;touch mkdir mydata.txt; echo "Sample Text for exercise 3" > mydata.txt

2. Create a docker container name 'local_vol' from the 'centos:6' image. The container should be created in interactive mode, attached to the current terminal and running the bash shell. Finally create the container with a volume (or directory) called 'containerdata' so that the system will automatically create the directory/mount when the container starts.
  - docker run -it --name="local_vol" -v /containerdata centos:6

3. List the filesystems within the container, specifically looking for the volume/directory that was added to the container during creation.
   
  - "df -h | grep /containerdata"  in the container

4. Exit the container. This time, create another container called 'remote_vol' with the same container configuration except when creating the volume in the container, link the volume name 'mydata' to the underlying host directory structure created in Step #1.

  - exit;docker run -it --name="remote_vol" -v $(pwd)/mydata:/containerdata centos:6 /bin/bash 

5. Once the container is started, list the disk mounts and verify the remote (host) volume is mounted. Change to that directory and verify that the text file created in Step #1 appears with the content created.
