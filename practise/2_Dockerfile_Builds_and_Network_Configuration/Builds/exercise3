NOTE: Although you should be able to run these commands on any Docker version on any Linux Distribution, for the purposes of these exercises, be sure you are running Docker v1.10+ as well as the latest CentOS or Ubuntu distribution. Be sure to have pulled the 'centos:6' and 'ubuntu:latest' images from the Docker Hub (docker pull) before starting this exercise.
1. Create a directory in your 'user' home directory called 'docker'. Within that directory, create another directory called 'mydata'. Within that directory, create a file called 'mydata.txt' containing any text message you want.
2. Create a docker container name 'local_vol' from the 'centos:6' image. The container should be created in interactive mode, attached to the current terminal and running the bash shell. Finally create the container with a volume (or directory) called 'containerdata' so that the system will automatically create the directory/mount when the container starts.
3. List the filesystems within the container, specifically looking for the volume/directory that was added to the container during creation.
4. Exit the container. This time, create another container called 'remote_vol' with the same container configuration except when creating the volume in the container, link the volume name 'mydata' to the underlying host directory structure created in Step #1.
5. Once the container is started, list the disk mounts and verify the remote (host) volume is mounted. Change to that directory and verify that the text file created in Step #1 appears with the content created.
