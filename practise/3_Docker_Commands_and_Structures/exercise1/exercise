#Exercise: Exercise: Base Image Maintenance and Cleanup
NOTE: Although you should be able to run these commands on any Docker version on any Linux Distribution, for the purposes of these exercises, be sure you are running Docker v1.10+ as well as the latest CentOS or Ubuntu distribution.


1. List all currently install Docker images. If you do not have at least three Docker base images at this point, please pull down other Docker images and/or follow the other exercises in this tutorial.

  - docker images # list all the installed images
  - docker pull <image_name:tag>  # to pull images

2. Execute the command to remove a base image that you have previously created a container from and note the resulting message.

  - docker rmi <image_name:tag> 
  - docker rmi -f <image_name:tag> # to remove the image forcefully

3. Run the appropriate command to remove the container that Step #2 indicated is preventing the deletion of that base image.
 
  - docker rm <container_id>

4. List all previously run containers and remove all of them one at a time. Verify that the command to list stopped containers shows nothing before continuing.

  - docker rm `docker ps -a -q`

5. Rerun the command executed in Step #2 and then list the base images on your system.
  
  - docker rmi <base_image_name:tag>
